- DESIGN gets visual identity
- GOV gets compliance/legal
- DEVOPS gets tool stack
- BLACKOUT gets competitor intel
- NEURAL CORE gets algorithm research
- CRUCIBLE gets testing framework

### **Step 3: Daily Standups (15 min/day)**
Every day at 10:00 AM:
- Each team reports progress
- Discuss blockers
- The General provides guidance
- Track in simple spreadsheet

---
